LINEAR REGRESSION

1️⃣ Team-level features (static before the match)

For each team:

Average stats of all Pokémon: HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed
Type coverage: number of unique types (e.g., Fire, Water, etc.)
Average base power of moves
Number of Pokémon with status moves, healing, etc.

You’d then make difference features between Team A and Team B:
avg_attack_diff = avg_attack_teamA - avg_attack_teamB
avg_speed_diff = avg_speed_teamA - avg_speed_teamB
etc....

2️⃣ Match-level features (dynamic summary)

Extract statistics from the turn-by-turn log:

Total damage dealt per team
Number of switch-ins / knockouts
Number of status inflictions (burn, paralysis, etc.)
Number of critical hits
These summarize how the battle evolved, so the model can learn from match dynamics too.


OPTIONAL:
3️⃣ Pokémon-level features (optional advanced step)
If you want to go deeper, flatten the teams:
Create aggregate features like “max HP Pokémon”, “fastest Pokémon”, etc.
Encode individual Pokémon using numeric stats and then average or concatenate.
